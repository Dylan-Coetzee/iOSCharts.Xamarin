# iOSCharts.Xamarin

A Xamarin binding by Lucas Teixeira for Charts (ios-charts) by Daniel Cohen Gindi, inspired by Philipp Jahoda
https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts

<h2>Charts 3.0</h2>
Requires Xcode 8 as the project has moved to Swift3. It's also a breaking change. To see the release notes go to: https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/releases/tag/v3.0.0

If you are updating from an older version of the library, please remove the Xamarin.Swift23.Support dependency, as it is not necessary anymore.

All the dependencies for Swift3 are already listed in the NuGet package. You can find the project for them in here: https://github.com/Flash3001/Xamarin.Swift3.Support

<h2>Important Notes for Charts 3.0.4 and Xcode 9</h2>
A version of the library was released to support Xcode 9 and it's dependencies in Nuget changed from Xamarin.Swift3.* to Xamarin.Swift4.* , please remove the old packages from your project.

<h2>Important Notes for Charts 2.2.5 and Xcode 8</h2>
If you updated to Xcode 8 there's a version of this library uploaded in NuGet pre-release channel.
https://www.nuget.org/packages/iOSCharts/2.2.5.2-xcode8

It is important as Xcode 8 dropped support for Swift 2.2 and now only works with 2.3 and 3.0.
This version was updated to work on 2.3.

Its SwiftSupport dependence has changed to https://github.com/Flash3001/Xamarin.Swift23.Support NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Swift23.Support/

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
When creating the IPA for publish you might get the following error:

<i>"Invalid Swift Support - The SwiftSupport folder is missing. Rebuild your app using the current public (GM) version of Xcode and resubmit it."</i>

When using Xcode 7 you might need use this script: https://github.com/jamesbar2/auto-ipa-packager or https://github.com/bq/ipa-packager

When using Xcode 8 (which updated Swift to 2.3 and 3.0) you should use this: https://github.com/Flash3001/ipa-packager

When using Xcode 9 (Swift 3.2 and 4.0) you should use this: https://github.com/bq/ipa-packager

Don't worry about the ipa-packager 'support version', the only difference is the path inside of the Xcode app. Xcode 8 supported two set of runtime libraries, but Xcode 6, 7 and 9 only support one and the path is the same for all.
